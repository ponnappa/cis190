M1 progress update

Mystery/Adventure game with text-based input and basic graphics
So far, we've spent a lot of time planning out how our smaller classes will interact with our game engine.
We've implemented most of these classes, but will need to modify them as we write the game engine. One issue
that we've come across is that our classes might need to be modified based on how exactly we write our story,
but we've tried to predict most of these possibilities and include them in the code. We still need an Item class,
and might need to include an Option class that will let us execute different sets of code based on what a
player chooses to do, although Observation may suffice. The better part of what we have left is the game engine.
We plan to initially implement the game so that it is only text based, then integrate QT into it.
